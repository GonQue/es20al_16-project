### End-to-end tests

#### Created tests
 - [Login creates and deletes a proposed question](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_16-project/blob/P3/frontend/cypress/integration/student/createProposedQuestion.js#L11)
 - [Login creates a proposed question without title](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_16-project/blob/P3/frontend/cypress/integration/student/createProposedQuestion.js#L17)
 - [Evaluate awaiting proposed question](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_16-project/blob/P3/frontend/cypress/integration/teacher/evaluateProposedQuestions.js#L21)
 - [Evaluate approved proposed question](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_16-project/blob/P3/frontend/cypress/integration/teacher/evaluateProposedQuestions.js#L28)
 - [Reject awaiting proposed question without justification](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_16-project/blob/P3/frontend/cypress/integration/teacher/evaluateProposedQuestions.js#L35)

#### Rationale
The 1st test relates to when a student creates a proposed question successfully. The 2nd test replicates when a student tries to create a proposed question without inserting a title, triggering an error.
The 3rd and 4th tests relate respectavely, to when a teacher evaluates a proposed question that is awaiting or re-evaluates a question that was previously approved. The last one simulates the error given when a teacher rejects a proposed question without writing a justification.

#### Rationale
End-to-end tests test the deployed application via its user interface. Problems related with frontend, like timing issues, browser quirks or unexpected popup dialogs would be more difficult to debug with common use cases. Although they require a lot of maintenance and run slowly, they allow us to identify dependencies and analyse the integrity of data throughout the components.

#### Rationale
The 1st and 4th tests relate to when a student creates tournaments correctly(one tournament with one topic and two tournaments with multiple topics respectively), and does not join them.

The 2nd and 3rd tests relate to when a student tries to create a tournament and an error ocurrs, wrong date and 0 questions, respectively.

The 5th and 6th tests relate to when a student creates tournaments, sees it's topics and joins it.
