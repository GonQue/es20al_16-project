### End-to-end tests

#### Created tests
 - [Login creates and deletes a proposed question](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_16-project/blob/P3/frontend/cypress/integration/student/createProposedQuestion.js#L11)
 - [Login creates a proposed question without title](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_16-project/blob/P3/frontend/cypress/integration/student/createProposedQuestion.js#L17)
 - [Evaluate awaiting proposed question](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_16-project/blob/P3/frontend/cypress/integration/teacher/evaluateProposedQuestions.js#L21)
 - [Evaluate approved proposed question](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_16-project/blob/P3/frontend/cypress/integration/teacher/evaluateProposedQuestions.js#L28)
 - [Reject awaiting proposed question without justification](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_16-project/blob/P3/frontend/cypress/integration/teacher/evaluateProposedQuestions.js#L35)

#### Rationale
The 1st test relates to when a student creates a proposed question successfully. The 2nd test replicates when a student tries to create a proposed question without inserting a title, triggering an error.
The 3rd and 4th tests relate respectavely, to when a teacher evaluates a proposed question that is awaiting or re-evaluates a question that was previously approved. The last one simulates the error given when a teacher rejects a proposed question without writing a justification.
